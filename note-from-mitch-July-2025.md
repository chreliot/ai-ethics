Ideally, following our upcoming meeting, we’ll be able to create a draft program proposal that contains the following items:
 
 1. Title, description, and core (general) learning objectives of the proposed program
 2. Title, course description, learning objectives, and tentative list of weekly topics for each of the first two courses
 3. List of electives that may fulfill the third course requirement
 
Our goal is to submit a first draft of the program proposal to Charlie, Eva, and Sina for their feedback and review by September 1st.

Thank you for your continued contributions!
